I presently have a [framework](https://frame.work) laptop both as my main computer and I was lucky enough to convince my employer, [American Public Television](https://aptonline.org), to purchase me one for app development. I could not be happier. They build quality and repairability are **perfect**. Customer service at framework is responsive. Linux is the best suited operating system for development and MS has finally realized that it's platform simply cannot compete with Unix and Mac for developers, particularly devs of the modern web that specialize in Javascript development. I speak from experience in that regard but I have heard tell that it is the case with other languages including Java and Python. In light of this, the Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL) that MS has developed is impressive.

> [Node/ NPM](http://nodejs.org) apps operate at an exponentially faster rate
> * simple React SPAs would take several minutes to boot up on Windows 11 with an i7 processor and 64gb of RAM !!!
> * After moving the files into the Linux home directory and running VS Code using this [Manjaro.exe](https://github.com/changrui/ManjaroWSL), apps would boot in seconds
> * * **it is essential to put the files into the Linux subsystem file structure to recieve performance benefits**
