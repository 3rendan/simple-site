I"S<p>I’m glad that you guys have liked and supported the theme to reach 100 stars on Github. I would like to thank everyone who has supported the theme by using, starring and recommending it.</p>

<p>Themes get better when people contribute. That is how our <a href="https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv" target="_blank">Online CV</a> got more than 250 likes. I would like to ask users to suggest changes and if possible create a pull-request.</p>

<p>You can still do it if you haven’t yet,</p>

<!-- Place this tag where you want the button to render. -->

<script async="" defer="" src="https://buttons.github.io/buttons.js"></script></p>

<p>Thank you</p>
